title: Week 2 - My first Firefox extension!
---

This past week, I and my team member Erica Chio made our first Firefox add-on for class. It is a simple notepad extension, that allows you to type a short note in the pop-up, save it, and return to it later while on your browser. Development-wise, I worked to build out the initial structure of the add-on, figure out what resources/tools we'd need (like an extra txt file, permissions, etc), and made the manifest.json and html files. 

My team really struggled with figuring out how to save the note, so that we could reference it again when re-opening the add-on. Our original idea was to have the text automatically write to a .txt file, then have that .txt file automatically display in the <input> tag in the html. However, we couldn't get the txt file to either save or load, despite numerous attempts. Eventually, Erica figured out a solution: to use localstorage to write to the .txt file, and adding a "submit" button to trigger the save. Ideally, our solution would save without needing the extra interaction with the button, but we have a working extension that performs the main functionality we desired, so I'm pretty satisfied in general.

In terms of using github for this project, I learned how to properly fork repos and set up upstreams to keep my local files up to date, as well as how to properly do pull requests.
