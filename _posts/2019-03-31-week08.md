title: Team Project Progress, 3/31
---

This week, my team and I made a final decision on what open source project we plan on doing our team project on. We were originally going to do it on a Wikimedia project, either Commons or Kiwix, but found the community to be exceptionally crowded, which would make it harder for us to be able to spend a more-than-short time on a feature or issue resolution.

Instead, we'll be doing our project on [Beagle](https://github.com/yampelo/beagle/), a young project intended for network security. It takes log files (from programs like Windows Event Viewer, Procmon, Sysmon, etc) and transforms them into graphs displaying connections between OS processes, files, IPs, and similar nodes. Our team discussed looking into this project to find a new feature to add or more functionality to develop for it (rather than just trying to solve an issue), since it's a promising project but isn't yet applicable to as many tools as security analysts would find useful. Through this research we all learned more about installing Docker, a container for running different software images (since this is what Beagle best runs through).

Next week we intend to find a specific problem to solve for the project, and make sure we all are comfortable using the software and navigating the files.
