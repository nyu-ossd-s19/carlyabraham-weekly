title: Week 4 - Open Source Project Evaluation
---

The project I chose to evaluate was Mail-in-a-Box, an open source email server. I chose this because I like the idea of self-owned communication services; as long as one is knowledgeable about information security, running your own mail server is one of the many cool ways to separate yourself from the corporate ownership of internet services that seems so inevitable today.

Below is some basic info about the project, and my perspective on the ~vibe~ the project's community gives out:

* Project website: https://mailinabox.email/
* Project's description: "Mail-in-a-Box lets you become your own mail service provider in a few easy steps. It’s sort of like making your own gmail, but one you control from top to bottom."
* Contributing: The project gives contribution instructions [here](https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). It was on the github's main readme, so it was pretty easy to find.
	* The contribution instructions give clear directions on how to make changes to your installation of Mail-in-a-Box and submit contributions while still following their license. Their [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) encourages a constructive, inclusive development environment.
* Project repo: https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox
* Issue tracker: https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox/issues
* Community Communication: Group slack can be joined at [this link](https://mailinabox.email/slack/).
* License: CC0 1.0 Universal (is not OSI approved)
* Programming Language: primarily written in Python
* Installation/set up directions: https://mailinabox.email/guide.html
	* They're well written, and seem easy to follow.

* Contributions: 124 contributors, 1606 commits.
* Issues: 178 open issues, 875 closed.
	* The most recent issue was opened 4 days ago; the last one closed was 1 day ago.
	* Issue discussion seems relatively active, with discussions being anywhere from 2 comments to 40. Unfortunately there don't seem to be any labels for beginner-friendly contribution, but there are issues labeled for documentation.
* Pull Requests: 41 open, 430 closed.
	* The most recent one was opened 2 days ago; the last one closed was 23 days ago.

Summary of the project: Ultimately, this project seems active, but perhaps not the most beginner-friendly - Not due to attitude (the community's discussions are productive and friendly) but due to the slightly-higher threshhold of knowledge needed to be able to confidently contribute. Labeling beginner-friendly issues and allowing more work for volunteers/testers would help. Otherwise, the maintainers are friendly in the discussions. Pull requests seem to get reviews semi-regularly. The community seems like a friendly one to be part of.
