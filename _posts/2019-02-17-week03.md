title: Week 3 - Collaborative Coding
---

With the Mozilla Firefox extionsion project done, it's good to look back on how my team and I collaborated throughout the project. We were able to get most of the work done remotely, using online messengers and checking git to stay up to date. For the most part, we volunteered separate parts to work on, and then reviewed each other's work and discussed revisions. This way, we were able to be efficient in not having two people work on one task at the same time, but still get the kind of peer approval that makes open source software effective. When discussing the decisions we had to make for the design of the project (like how we would save text, what the aesthetics would be, etc) we prioritized working to our skill sets more than a perhaps more outlandish idea.

Overall, I found working collaboratively on this open source project to be a great way to work on tech projects, as long as everybody communicates effectively, respects each others' opinions, and voices their expectations throughout the work.
